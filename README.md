COVID-19 Dataset Analysis SQL Queries Summary


1This repository contains a series of SQL queries designed to analyze a COVID-19 dataset. The queries provide insights into various aspects of the pandemic, focusing on cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations, with a specific emphasis on the African continent.

*Total Cases and Deaths in Africa: This query calculates the death percentage for each date in African countries by dividing the total deaths by total cases. It presents a picture of COVID-19's impact on the African continent over time.

*Total Cases vs. Population in Africa: Here, the query compares the total COVID-19 cases to the population in African countries, presenting the death percentage relative to the population size.

*Countries with the Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population: This query identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population, highlighting the impact of the virus on different nations.

*Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population: The query focuses on countries with the highest death counts in proportion to their population, offering insights into regions that have been severely affected.

*Continents with the Highest Death Count per Population: This query extends the analysis to continents, identifying the continents with the highest death counts in relation to their population.

*Total Populations vs. Vaccinations: The query examines the relationship between total populations and COVID-19 vaccinations, showcasing the number of people vaccinated relative to the population for various locations.

*Using CTE to Perform Partition: This query employs a Common Table Expression (CTE) to perform a partitioned analysis of population and vaccinations, providing a more structured and organized output.

These SQL queries offer valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic's impact, particularly focusing on Africa, and can serve as a starting point for further analysis or visualization of the dataset.

Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt these queries to suit your analysis requirements and project goals.
